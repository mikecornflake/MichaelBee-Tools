We finally have Ver 5.00 MWB Basic ROMs that were released in the original Kit Microbee.

ROMs kindly supplied by MSPP member: rhysweatherley

ROM names changed to the standard MSPP release names. The 16 KB ROM
are the four 4 KB ROMs concatenated.

To use under the uBee512 emulator:

ubee512 kit --basica basic_5.00_a.rom --basicb basic_5.00_b.rom --basicc basic_5.00_c.rom --basicd basic_5.00_d.rom

Or the supplied 16 KB concatenated ROM may also be used:

ubee512 kit --basic basic_5.00.rom
